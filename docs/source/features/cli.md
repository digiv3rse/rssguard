                                 single instance application mode.

Arguments:
  urls                           List of URL addresses pointing to individual
                                 online feeds which should be added.
```

You can add feeds to RSS Guard by passing URLs as the command line parameters too. Feed [URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_URI_scheme) is supported, so that you can call RSS Guard like this:

```powershell
rssguard.exe "feed://archlinux.org/feeds/news"
rssguard.exe "feed:https//archlinux.org/feeds/news"
rssguard.exe "https://archlinux.org/feeds/news"
```

In order to easily add the feed directly from your web browser of choice, without copying and pasting the URL manually, you have to open RSS Guard with feed URL passed as an argument. There are [browser extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-with/) which will allow you to do it.

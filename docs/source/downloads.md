Downloads
=========
Official place to download RSS Guard is at [Github Releases page](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/releases). You can also download the [development (beta) build](https://github.com/martinrotter/rssguard/releases/tag/devbuild), which is updated automatically every time the source code is updated.

RSS Guard is also available in [repositories of many Linux distributions](https://repology.org/project/rssguard/versions), and via [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/search?q=rssguard).

The are two different [flavors](#features/browseradblock):
* Regular: Includes an (almost) full-blown integrated web browser (built with `-NO_LITE=ON`).
* Lite: Includes simpler, safer (and less memory hungry integrated web browser (built with `-NO_LITE=OFF`).

I highly recommend to download RSS Guard only from trusted sources.
